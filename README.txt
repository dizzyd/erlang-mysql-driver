Description: Revamped MySQL driver for Erlang
Modified by: Yariv Sadan (yarivvv@gmail.com)

This MySQL driver for Erlang is based on the Yxa driver obtained from Process One (at https://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/Yxa). It includes several new features such as prepared statements, transactions, binary queries, type-converted query results, more efficient logging and a new connection pooling mechanism.
